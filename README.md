# first-js-app
 This is a Pokedex app which enables the user to click on a Pokemon name and view the name, height, weight, types, abilities and an image of the Pokemon.
 The user can also search for a particular Pokemon.
 I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap to design and make my app interactive.  

 I retrieved my data using json from the API, pokeapi.co.
